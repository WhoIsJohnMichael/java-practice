# Cody's First Day
<u>by CodeChum Admin</u>

It's Cody's first day of school, and as a robot, he doesn't have an age to share with his new classmates. To avoid standing out, he decides to follow the age of the majority of his classmates, which is 5 years old.

If you find yourself in a similar situation where you need to print out a specific number, all you need to do is run a simple program. In this case, running the program will print out the number 5 for you.

 

So, if you're ready to blend in with the crowd like Cody, all you need to do is write a program that prints the number 5.

###### Sample Output 1
