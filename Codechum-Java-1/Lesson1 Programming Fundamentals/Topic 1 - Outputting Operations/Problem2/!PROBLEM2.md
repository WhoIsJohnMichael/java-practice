# Cody's Goodbye
<u>by CodeChum Admin</u>
<hr/>

It’s the end of class, and like all 5 year old students, it is customary for them to greet their teachers goodbye before leaving. Why do they do this? I don’t know either but humans are weird that way. It is important for Cody to follow this custom regardless. Have Cody print "goodbye and thank you".


###### Sample Output 1
```
goodbye and thank you
