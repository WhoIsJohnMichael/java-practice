# Math is Fun
<u>by CodeChum Admin</u>

Hello there!

 

I'm a math teacher from the school around the neighborhood and I've heard from my co-teacher there that you were the one behind all those amazing games that the students in the school are loving so I've come to ask for your help as well!

 

You see, since young people nowadays are so into technology, I think that if I make my math lessons digital and tech-related then they'd be willing to learn about it more, so I want to ask for your help on starting this plan with just simply showing them an addition example, digitally.

 

I know it's quite sudden, but can I ask help from you, too?

 

First, there are two variables containing integer values that are already prepared for you in the code editor on the side. Then, create a variable and store the sum of the two given integers. Lastly, print out the statement like that of the sample output using placeholders.


#### Sample Output 1

```
The sum of 10 and 20 is 30
