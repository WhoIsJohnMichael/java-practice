# Special Cody
<u>by CodeChum Admin</u>

That age problem was a close one, huh? But it seems that wasn’t enough to convince the kids that Cody IS NOT a robot, after all, Cody’s face is literally a computer monitor so who could blame them? Now, the kids are testing Cody by having him print special characters like " and \. They assumed that Cody wouldn’t be able to print these special characters if he functioned under a computer program but lucky for us, The Programmer anticipated something like this, remember? To teach these kids a lesson, have Cody print <b>Look! I can print "special" 'characters' like \.</b> to clear all suspicions of him being a robot.

##### Sample Output 1

```
Look! I can print "special" 'characters' like \.
